# Bike Rides Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of bike ride patterns in London, leveraging data visualization and machine learning techniques to uncover actionable insights. The goal is to understand how external factors such as weather conditions and seasonal trends influence bike usage, enabling data-driven decisions for urban planning, transportation management, and marketing strategies.


## Project Overview

The analysis focuses on identifying patterns and correlations between bike ride volumes and external factors like temperature, wind speed, and time of year. By visualizing these relationships, the project aims to provide actionable insights for optimizing bike-sharing operations and improving urban mobility.

## Project Highlights

### 1. **Dynamic Moving Average Analysis**
   - Utilized a dynamic moving average to identify trends and seasonality in bike ride volumes over time.
   - Enabled customizable time windows to analyze short-term fluctuations and long-term patterns.

### 2. **Weather Impact Analysis**
   - Conducted a correlation analysis between weather variables (temperature, wind speed) and bike ride volumes.
   - Created heatmaps to visualize how weather conditions influence bike usage, highlighting optimal and suboptimal conditions for cycling.

### 3. **Interactive Tableau Dashboard**
   - Developed an interactive dashboard to explore bike ride trends and insights.
   - Included features like dynamic filters, time series visualizations, and weather impact heatmaps for a user-friendly experience.


## Tableau Dashboard Features

The dashboard is designed to provide a holistic view of bike ride patterns and their influencing factors. Key components include:

- **Total Rides Overview:** Displays the total number of bike rides within a selected time frame, offering a quick snapshot of overall usage.
- **Time Series Analysis:** Visualizes bike ride trends over time, with an adjustable moving average to highlight seasonality and trends.
- **Weather Impact Heatmap:** Compares temperature and wind speed against bike ride volumes, revealing how weather conditions affect usage.
- **Interactive Filters:** Allows users to customize views by selecting specific date ranges, moving average periods, and weather conditions.


## Python Analysis

The Jupyter notebook contains the following steps:

### 1. **Data Extraction and Cleaning**
   - Loaded the dataset from KaggleHub using Pythonâ€™s Pandas library.
   - Performed data cleaning, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Analyzed bike ride patterns over time, identifying peak usage periods and seasonal trends.
   - Investigated correlations between bike ride volumes and weather variables (temperature, wind speed).

### 3. **Actionable Insights**
   - Derived insights to support urban planning decisions, such as optimizing bike availability during peak seasons and adverse weather conditions.
   - Provided recommendations for improving bike-sharing operations based on data-driven findings.
