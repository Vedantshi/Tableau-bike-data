# London Bike Rides Analysis

This project analyzes bike ride patterns in London, providing actionable insights using data visualization techniques and machine learning models.

## Project Overview

The goal is to understand how various factors such as temperature, wind speed, and time of year impact bike usage. By visualizing this data, we can make data-driven decisions for urban planning, transportation management, and marketing.

## Project Highlights

- **Dynamic Moving Average Analysis:** Identified trends and patterns in bike rides over time.
- **Weather Impact Analysis:** Correlated temperature and wind speed with bike ride volume using heatmaps.
- **Interactive Tableau Dashboard:** Enabled exploration of trends and insights using an interactive dashboard.

## Tableau Dashboard

The dashboard includes the following components:

- **Total Rides Overview:** Displays the total number of bike rides within the selected time frame.
- **Time Series Analysis:** Visualizes bike ride trends with a customizable moving average to identify seasonality.
- **Weather Impact Heatmap:** Compares temperature and wind speed against bike ride volume, highlighting influential weather patterns.
- **Interactive Filters:** Allow users to customize views based on date ranges and moving average periods.

## Python Analysis

The Jupyter notebook contains:

- **Data Extraction:** Loaded data using KaggleHub and performed data cleaning with Pandas.
- **Data Insights:** Derived actionable insights to support urban planning decisions.

## Recommendations for Recruiters

- **Skills Demonstrated:** Data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis.
- **Tools Used:** Python (Pandas), Tableau.
- **Business Impact:** Recommendations for optimizing bike-sharing operations based on weather conditions and seasonal trends.

## Future Enhancements

- Develop predictive models to forecast bike ride volumes.
- Incorporate additional factors like holidays and special events.
- Build interactive geospatial visualizations to analyze regional patterns.
