# Bike Rides Analysis

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of bike ride behavior, focusing on how weather conditions and seasonal trends influence usage patterns. Through interactive visualizations and exploratory data analysis, the goal is to support data-driven decision-making for urban planners, transportation agencies, and mobility service providers.

By uncovering correlations between environmental factors and ridership, the project provides practical recommendations to improve bike-sharing infrastructure, optimize resource allocation, and enhance user experience.

## Project Highlights

### Dynamic Moving Average Analysis
- Applied customizable moving averages to reveal short-term fluctuations and long-term seasonal trends.
- Helps operators identify patterns that aren’t visible in raw time series data.

### Weather Impact Analysis
- Explored the relationship between ride volume and variables like temperature and wind speed.
- Used heatmaps to visually communicate optimal cycling conditions for city-wide planning.

### Interactive Tableau Dashboard
- Developed an executive-friendly dashboard featuring:
  - Ride volume trends
  - Seasonal variation
  - Weather impact heatmaps
  - Custom filters for flexible exploration
